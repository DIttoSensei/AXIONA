AXIONA is an AI project, which leverages the capabilities of the DialogPT model to create advanced conversational agents. Here are some key aspects:

Purpose: AXIONA aims to develop intelligent chatbots that can engage in natural and meaningful conversations with users. These chatbots can be used in various applications, such as customer support, virtual assistants, and interactive entertainment.

Technology: The project uses the DialogPT model, a powerful transformer-based model designed for generating human-like text. This model is fine-tuned on specific datasets to improve its conversational abilities.

Training: The training process involves preparing a dataset of conversational data, tokenizing the text, and training the model to understand and generate appropriate responses. The training is done offline using local resources.

Non-Commercial License: AXIONA is distributed under a non-commercial license, which allows others to use the model for non-commercial purposes while giving credit to the original creators.

Applications: The chatbots created with AXIONA can be integrated into websites, mobile apps, and other platforms to provide users with interactive and responsive conversational experiences.

Libraries
This model is compatible with the following libraries:

Transformers: transformers library by Hugging Face for model training and inference.
Torch: PyTorch library for deep learning.
Usage
You can load the model using the transformers library as follows:

from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer

model_name = "your-username/your-model-repo"
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(model_name)
